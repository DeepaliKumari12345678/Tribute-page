    <h1 class="header">In Admiration of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <p class="text">I am truly inspired by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for their exceptional qualities and achievements. 
        A great scientist, people’s President, and a phenomenal teacher, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam has been the driving force behind many cutting-edge technologies in India. 
        Their dedication, passion, and perseverance in Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. have left a profound impact on me.</p>
    <p class="text">Through He Was The Brain Behind Multiple Nuclear Tests Carried Out At Pokhran In 1998 Which Made India A Nuclear Weapon State.
        Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister of India between 1992 and 1999 when India went ahead with the nuclear explosions at Pokhran. He supervised the Pokhran II explosions as the CEO of DRDO. While camping in the Thar desert for over a fortnight, he said:
        
        “The testing was a ‘defining moment’ in the country’s history, next only to adopting the path of economic liberalisation in 1991.”</p>
    <p class="text">Their remarkable journey serves as a reminder that with hard work and determination, anyone can achieve their dreams. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from their experiences and apply those lessons to my own life.</p>
    <p class="text">Thank you, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam sir, for being an incredible source of inspiration!</p>
